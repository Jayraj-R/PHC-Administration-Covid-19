This project is a Hospital Management System created for the purpose of managing medical facilities for our college PDPM IIITDMJ .

The basic idea of the project is that people who need to get administered would have to register by the link provided. After they entered their details ,they would be given a slot (basically a time zone) , the patient would then visit at that particular time zone for treatment. The time slot is decided such that the patient will get the first time slot avaailable at that period of time. Further on treatment it would be decided if they are to stay at the hospital or not. All the information related to the patient such as symtoms, room no( if alloted) , discharged date , so on and so forth.


We have used Mysql , PHP, HTML and CSS to develop this system.  Html and CSS are used for  the frontend . PHP and MYSQl are used for the backend functionality and managing the database respectively. Further we have used phpmailer .Phpmailer is used to automatically send the email to the patients email id ,notifying them of their registration and time slot , they are supposed to visit.

The features provided by the PHC Administration are:
1) Alot a bed
2) dealot a bed
3) Number of beds available
4) Doctors details
5) patient list
6) Reset timeslots
7)Covid19 patients

The main function is to allot the time slot for the patient. This is done automatically by a php program. The general idea is that we will allocate bed according to time of registration for one paricualar day. After that the adminstrator would have to press the reset slot button .So the time slots would be cleared and new patient name and details could then be automatically entered as per their time of registration.

This project aims to ease the process of managing the treatment of patients , helping both the adminstration and the patient themselves. All the patient has to do is enter theor details on the php adminstration link making this whole complex process hassle free.
